<h3> Just A Little Bit About Me </h3>
<p>
Hello World, my name is Reece. I'm here to tell you a bit about myself. I am 18 years old, old enough to go to war- yet not old enough to drink. <br> Not that I'd have a problem with 
that little bit, but it's important to first know that I may have a slight issue with the stringent, unsaid rules of society here in America and how we as people are meant to go through the systems of life and follow it's ways
to the <strong><em>T!</em></strong> My hobbies include writing music, and listening to it when I'm in the mood to have my mindset changed because that's what music does; it changes the persepective of the consumer at a rate which is unlike anything else- simliar to a book!
I like to find knowledge that can be shared with my peers to widen my own and their understandings of everything this world has to offer, cause I for one am not too well versed in knowledge in general. 
<br>I like to consider myself a curious soul, someone who consumes energies like a sponge and expels it out again into nature as it was. I love meeting new people and creating connections,
especially forming intellectual or emotional relationships. I'm still learning my ways through this reality at such a young age, with its social ques and proper ways of acting, I don't like how 
people can be considered indecent or abnormal in this world when we are all just people! We are all just people just living in different skins but vibrating at the same frequency in time. I don't often about this 
because after all this is the world we live in, but escapism for me has acted as a way of conjuring up imaginary realities inside of my minds eye during times of stress, or points of extreme existentialism and detatchment. I have three siblings, all brothers and I'm quite certain 
my mother wishes she just had 1 daughter, just 1!! Only kidding- haha.
